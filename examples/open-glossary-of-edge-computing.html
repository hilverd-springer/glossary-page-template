                            3rd, 4th, and 5th generation cellular technologies, respectively. In simple terms, 3G
                            represents the introduction of the smartphone along with their mobile web browsers; 4G, the
                            current generation cellular technology, delivers true broadband internet access to mobile
                            devices; the coming 5G cellular technologies will deliver massive bandwidth and reduced
                            latency to cellular systems, supporting a range of devices from smartphones to autonomous
                            vehicles and large-scale IoT. Edge computing at the infrastructure edge is considered a key
                            building block for 5G.

                            The sub-layer of the Service Provider Edge closest to the physical last mile networks, zero
                            or one hops from the RAN or cable headend. For example, an edge data center deployed at a
                            cellular network site. The Access Edge Layer functions as the front line of the Service
                            Provider Edge and typically connects to the Regional Edge layer upstream in the hierarchy.
                            Edge compute at the Access Edge consists of highly-distributed server-class infrastructure
                            located at front- and mid-haul sites, such as cell towers, cable distribution plants,
                            aggregation and pre-aggregation hubs,central offices, and other facilities which house
                            network access equipment such as cellular radio base stations, as well as xDSL and xPON
                            equipment. Access Edge data centers are often of the micro-modular variety because of their
                            ease of deployment and self-contained operation. Because of the need to support
                            ultra-low-latency workloads, including those that require a predictable connection to the
                            last mile network, Access Edge facilities are typically sited within 15km of the radio heads
                            or cable head ends and are best used for workloads that require latencies in the sub-1ms -
                            30ms range.

                            An evolution of the RAN that allows the functionality of the wireless base station to be
                            split into two components: A Remote Radio Head (RRH) and a centralized BBU. Rather than
                            requiring a BBU to be located with each cellular radio antenna, C-RAN allows the BBUs to
                            operate at some distance from the tower, at an aggregation point, often referred to as a
                            Distributed Antenna System (DAS) Hub. Co-locating multiple BBUs in an aggregation facility
                            creates infrastructure efficiencies and allows for a more graceful evolution to Cloud RAN.
                            In a C-RAN architecture, tasks performed by a legacy base station are often performed as
                            VNFs operating on infrastructure edge micro data centers on general-purpose compute
                            hardware. These tasks must be performed at high levels of performance and with as little
                            latency as possible, requiring the use of infrastructure edge computing at the cellular
                            network site to support them.

                            storage without dense compute resources. When using infrastructure edge computing CDN nodes
                            operate in software at edge data centers.

                            In academic circles, this term refers to a mobility-enhanced public or private cloud at the
                            infrastructure edge, as popularized by Mahadev Satyanarayanan of Carnegie Mellon University.
                            It is synonymous with the term Edge Cloud as defined in this glossary. It has also been used
                            interchangeably with Edge Data Center and Edge Node in the literature. In a 3-tier computing
                            architecture, the term &quot;cloudlet&quot; refers to the middle tier (Tier 2), with Tier 1
                            being the cloud and Tier 3 being a smartphone, wearable device, smart sensor or other such
                            weight/size/energy-constrained entity. In the context of CDNs such as Akamai, cloudlet
                            refers to the practice of deploying self-serviceable applications at CDN nodes.

                            A cloud native network function (CNF) is a cloud native application that implements network
                            functionality. A CNF consists of one or more microservices and has been developed using
                            Cloud Native Principles including immutable infrastructure, declarative APIs, and a
                            “repeatable deployment process”. An example of a simple CNF is a packet filter that
                            implements a single piece of network functionality as a microservice. A firewall is an
                            example of a CNF which may be composed of more than one microservice (i.e. encryption,
                            decryption, access lists, packet inspection, etc.).

                            An edge computing use case where tasks are offloaded from an edge device to the
                            infrastructure edge for remote processing. Computational offloading seeks, for example,
                            performance improvements and energy savings for mobile devices by offloading computation to
                            the infrastructure edge with the goal of minimizing task execution latency and mobile device
                            energy consumption. Computational offloading also enables new classes of mobile applications
                            that would require computational power and storage capacity that exceeds what the device
                            alone is capable of employing (e.g., untethered Virtual Reality). In other cases, workloads
                            may be offloaded from a centralized to an edge data center for performance. The term is also
                            referred to as cloud offload and cyber foraging in the literature.

                            An initiative to deploy data center-level compute and data storage capability within the CO.
                            Although this is often logical topologically, CO facilities are typically not physically
                            suited to house compute, data storage and network resources on the scale of an edge data
                            center due to their inadequate flooring, as well as their heating, cooling, ventilation,
                            fire suppression and power delivery systems.

                            application within a nuclear power plant that has no connection to the cloud would not be
                            considered an Edge-Native Application. May use edge capabilities to provide data ingest,
                            data reduction, real-time decision support, or to solve data sovereignty issues.

                            must arrive on time and in a predictable fashion and a failure to do so could result in
                            critical or life-threatening malfunction. Resources like PLCs, RTUs and ECUs have been used

                            due to a higher degree of locality to user than with a centralized or regional data center.

                            VoIP, autonomous driving and online gaming which assume little latency variation is present
                            and are sensitive to changes in this metric.

                            The segment of a telecommunications network that connects the service provider to the
                            customer. The type of connection and distance between the customer and the infrastructure
                            determines the performance and services available to the customer. The last mile is part of
                            the access network, and is also the network segment closest to the user that is within the
                            control of the service provider. Examples of this include cabling from a DOCSIS headend site
                            to a cable modem, or the wireless connection between a customer&#39;s mobile device and a
                            cellular network site.

                            in terms of milliseconds at single or repeated points in time between two or more endpoints.
                            A key metric of optimizing the modern application user experience. Distinct from jitter
                            which refers to the variation of latency over time. Sometimes expressed as Round Trip Time
                            (RTT).

                            tightly coupled with the Radio Access Network (RAN). Formalized in 2014, MEC seeks to
                            augment 4G and 5G wireless base stations with a standardized software platform, API and
                            programming model for building and deploying applications at the edge of the wireless
                            networks. MEC allows for the deployment of services such as radio-aware video optimization,
                            which utilizes caching, buffering and real-time transcoding to reduce congestion of the
                            cellular network and improve the user experience. Originally known as Mobile Edge Computing,
                            the ETSI working group renamed itself to Multi-Access Edge Computing in 2016 in order to
                            acknowledge their ambition to expand MEC beyond cellular to include other access
                            technologies. Utilizes edge data centers deployed at the infrastructure edge.

                            A subcategory of the User Edge consisting of server-class compute infrastructure located
                            within, or in close proximity to, buildings operated by end users, such as offices and
                            factories. IT equipment in these locations is housed within traditional, privately-owned
                            data centers and Modular Data Centers (MDCs). These resources are moderately scalable within
                            the confines of available real estate, power and cooling. Tools for security and MANO are
                            similar to those used in cloud data centers.

                            A subcategory of the Service Provider Edge consisting of server-class infrastructure located
                            in regional data centers which also tend to serve as major peering sites. Regional edge
                            sites are commonly in the form of Multi-Tenant Colocation (MTCO) facilities owned by
                            companies like Equinix and Digital Realty, but can also take the form of a backhaul facility
                            owned by a telco network that has been upgraded to house server-class IT equipment. Regional
                            Edge sites usually provide, also, a regional Internet Exchange (IX) point, where tenants can
                            connect to other networks and reach nationwide Internet backbones. Large cloud providers,
                            web-scale companies, CDNs and other enterprises place servers and storage in these
                            facilities to reduce the latency and network hops that would otherwise be required to reach
                            a centralized data center, but which do not require the ultra low-latencies available at the
                            Access Edge or at the User Edge. A rich confluence of data passes through these locations.
                            Edge computing resources in a regional data center can work in conjunction with resources at
                            the Access Edge and the User Edge to deliver different tiers of latency. As a general rule,
                            Regional Edge data centers are capable of supporting edge workloads that can tolerate
                            latencies in the 30ms - 100ms range.

                            networks in a metropolitan region and encompasses the physical geography between the access
                            networks and the nearest internet exchange (IX) points. The Service Provider Edge further
                            subdivides into the Access Edge and Regional Edge and is typically capable of delivering
                            edge computing with sub-100ms latencies. Formerly referred to as the Infrastructure Edge.

                            containerization technologies for cloud-native software development. These resources span
                            consumer-grade mobile devices and PCs to hardened, headless gateways and servers that are
                            deployed for IoT use cases, such as in challenging environments that include factory floors,
                            building equipment rooms, farms and weatherproof enclosures distributed within a city (see
                            IoT Edge). While capable of general-purpose compute, these devices are
                            performance-constrained for various reasons including cost, battery life, form factor and
                            ruggedization (both thermal and physical) and therefore have a practical limit on processing
                            expandability when compared to resources in an upstream data center. There is an increasing
                            trend for these systems to feature co-processing in the form of Graphics Processing Units
                            (GPUs) or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate analytics, with the added
                            benefit of distributing thermal dissipation which is beneficial in extreme environments.
                            Resources at the Smart Device Edge can be deployed and used as separate devices (e.g., a
                            smartphone or IoT gateway on a factory floor) or they can be embedded into distributed,

                            be transmitted between two or more endpoints. Measured in terms of bits per second typically
                            at megabit or gigabit scales as required. Although a minimum level of throughput is often
                            required for applications to function, after this latency typically becomes the
                            application-limiting and user experience-damaging factor.

                            side of the last mile networks. User Edge resources are adjacent to end-users and processes
                            in the physical world and encompass a wide range of equipment types, including gateways,
                            servers, and end user devices. Workloads on the User Edge often work in conjunction with
                            resources on the Service Provider Edge but are able to achieve lower latencies and conserve
                            broadband network bandwidth by processing data without requiring it to pass across the last
                            mile networks. Compared to the Service Provider Edge, the User Edge represents a highly
                            diverse mix of resources. The User Edge contains the subcategories On-Premises Data Center
                            Edge, Smart Device Edge and Constrained Device Edge. See also: On-Premises Data Center Edge,

/* START OF editor.js

This script starts a simple server listening on localhost.

* GET requests are served by local HTML/JS/CSS files.
* PATCH requests to / expect to receive an HTML fragment string in the body.
  This string is used to update the glossary file, replacing
    <article id="glossary"
      ...
    </article>.

This allows the Elm application to save any updates made in the UI.
