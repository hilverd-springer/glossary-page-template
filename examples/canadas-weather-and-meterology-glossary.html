                        <dd>Canadian sea-ice terminology that is not a part of the World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) terminology. It defines large, thick, uneven and discoloured ice floes that form on the upstream side of shoals and islets in rivers, when cold weather precedes or accompanies neap tides. It is composed of ice of different thicknesses formed under pressure during ebb tide, the entire mass freezes together and gradually increasing in size, with each successive tide. As the range increases between the neap and spring tides, large sections of grounded ice break away and drift down river causing the floes.</dd>

                        <dd>Chinooks occur when mountain ranges are exposed to strong prevailing crosswinds. Moist air is forced up the mountains bringing both clouds and precipitation to the windward side. The descending air becomes warmer and drier as it is forced down the leeward (sheltered) side of the mountains. The relatively warm, dry, gusty winds that occasionally occur to the leeward side of mountain ranges around the world are known by many names. In Canada and the northern United States, they are referred to as Chinooks. In the southern states, they are known as Santa Ana winds and in parts of Europe, foehn winds.</dd>

Limited areas of the ice shelf may be attached to land. The edge facing the sea is termed as ice front.</dd>

                        <dd>Sea-ice terminology. Describes old ice that has survived only one summer’s melt. Thicker than first-year ice, it stands higher out of the water. In contrast to multi-year ice, summer melting of second-year ice produces a regular pattern of numerous small puddles. In this case, bare patches and puddles are usually greenish-blue.</dd>

Deep low-pressure systems can create a dome of water under the storm (much like the low pressure in a vacuum on a carpet). High winds along a coastline can also elevate the water levels at the shore, depending on the direction of the wind with respect to the coast. For powerful storms like hurricanes, the abnormally high water levels are due mostly to the high winds and high waves at the coast.</dd>

                        <dd>A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a cumuliform cloud to the surface. The pressure deficit in a tornado often results in the formation of a funnel cloud that extends fully or partially from the cumuliform cloud to the surface. A tornado is typically also made visible by rotating debris near the ground or a spray ring near the water surface.

A tornado can be tens to hundreds of metres wide and have a lifespan of minutes or hours. In terms of size and area, it is one of the least extensive of all storms, but in terms of how violent storms can be, it is the world&#39;s most severe.

Canada has the second highest tornado occurrence rate in the world, behind the United States. In Canada, tornadoes occur mostly on the Prairies and in southern Ontario with a peak frequency in late June and July.</dd>

                        <dd>The generic term for the class of tropical low pressure systems, including tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes.

These non-frontal cyclones originate over tropical or sub-tropical waters, and are identified by their organized showers and thundershowers, mixed with a cyclonic surface wind circulation. They are unlike extratropical cyclones in that they are generally symmetric in their temperature, rain and wind patterns.

The rainfall in tropical cyclones is not dependent on the intensity of the storm. The driving mechanism for a tropical cyclone is the release of latent heat.

Tropical cyclone systems typically last a week or more.</dd>
