                        <dd>An Act of Parliament (also called a statute) is a law made by the UK Parliament. All Acts start as bills introduced in either the Commons or the Lords. When a bill has been agreed by both Houses of Parliament and has been given Royal Assent by the Monarch, it becomes an Act. Acts are known as ‘primary legislation’ because they do not depend on other legislative authority.</dd>

                        <dd>An adjournment motion is literally a motion: &#39;That this House (or sitting) do now adjourn&#39;. In the Commons, however, debates on adjournment motions have covered almost every imaginable topic. This is because they have conventionally been used as a device to enable the House to discuss a particular issue in general terms and without needing to make a specific decision at the end. Nowadays these general debates often take place on the motion: &#39;That this House has considered [a specific issue]&#39;. In the House of Lords, general debates can take place on a &#39;motion to take note&#39; of a particular matter, or by tabling a Question for Short Debate.</dd>

Its name describes the form of scrutiny that the SI receives from Parliament. An SI laid under the affirmative procedure must be actively approved by both Houses of Parliament. Certain SIs on financial matters are only considered by the Commons.</dd>

                        <dd>Allocation of time or &#39;guillotine&#39; motions have been used by governments to limit the amount of time that MPs can spend debating a particular stage of a Bill in the House of Commons. In recent years these have been replaced by Programme motions which set out a more detailed timetable for each stage of a Government Bill in the Commons and are moved as soon as a Bill has passed its Second reading. There is no equivalent in the House of Lords where the government cannot limit debating time.</dd>

Consideration of Amendments is the name for what is often the final stage of Bill. When a Bill has been passed by one House but then is amended by the other House, those amendments must be considered by the first House. There may be some to-ing and fro-ing between the Houses before a final version of the Bill is agreed.</dd>

At the start of each new parliamentary year, backbench MPs are invited to enter their names into a ballot. The few MPs who are lucky in the draw may each bring in a Bill of their choosing, known as a Ballot Bill. Ballot Bills take priority over other Private Members&#39; Bills when time is allocated for debates and so have a better chance of becoming law. In the Lords, a Private Members&#39; Bill ballot takes place at the start of a session to decide the order in which the first 25 Private Members&#39; Bills will be introduced.</dd>

They are made by the General Synod and require Parliament’s approval to come into force. Draft measures are considered by the Ecclesiastical Committee, formed of MPs and members of the House of Lords. If the Committee approves a draft, the measure is presented to both Houses for approval and then – if approval is granted – to the monarch for Royal Assent.</dd>

If such a motion is agreed to, and a new government with the support of a majority of MPs cannot be formed within a period of 14 calendar days, Parliament is dissolved and an early general election is triggered. No confidence motions worded in other ways would not have such an effect. A motion of no confidence in the government is one of only two ways in which an early general election may be triggered under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011. However, the Dissolution and Calling of Parliaments Bill 2021-22 contains measures which would repeal the FtPA.</dd>

                        <dd>The EVEL process operated in the House of Commons from 2015 until its suspension in 2020. The standing orders relating to EVEL procedures were rescinded following a decision of the House on 13 July 2021. While in use, EVEL was designed to ensure that legislation that affected only England, or England and Wales, was approved by a majority of MPs representing English constituencies, or English and Welsh constituencies. It also applied to legislation introducing a tax measure that affected only England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which had to be approved by a majority of MPs representing constituencies in those areas. EVEL could be applied to a whole bill, specific clauses or schedules, Lords amendments, a statutory instrument, or specific Budget resolutions. There were two tests that had be met for EVEL to apply. The first test was that the bill (or clause or schedule of the bill), statutory instrument or Budget resolution related exclusively to England (or England and Wales, or England, Wales and Northern Ireland). The second test was that it was “within devolved legislative competence”. In other words, that the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly could legislate in their territories on the same matter.</dd>

In the House of Lords, debates on statutory instrument (SIs) can be held in either the Chamber or in Grand Committee. Decisions can be made in Grand Committee but divisions (votes) only take place in the Chamber. If the SI is debated (considered) in Grand Committee, it must be approved by a separate motion in the Lords Chamber at a later date (although this is usually done without further comment). If the debate takes place in the Chamber both discussion and approval can happen at the same time. All members of the Lords can attend and speak in Grand Committee, it refers to the location rather than a specific committee with a limited membership.</dd>

                        <dd>Allocation of time or &#39;guillotine&#39; motions have been used by governments to limit the amount of time that MPs can spend debating a particular stage of a Bill in the House of Commons. In recent years these have been replaced by Programme motions which set out a more detailed timetable for each stage of a Government Bill in the Commons and are moved as soon as a Bill has passed its Second reading. There is no equivalent in the House of Lords where the government cannot limit debating time.</dd>

The Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee pays particular attention to any proposal in a bill to use a Henry VIII clause because of the way it shifts power to the executive. The expression is a reference to King Henry VIII&#39;s supposed preference for legislating directly by proclamation rather than through Parliament.</dd>

Before the Act, the House of Lords had been made up exclusively of hereditary Peers. A life Peer cannot pass their title on to his or her children. Although life Peers are appointed by the Crown, it is the Prime Minister who nominates them. By convention the Leader of the Opposition and other party leaders can propose a certain number.</dd>

The Lord Chancellor was also head of the judiciary and the senior judge of the House of Lords in its judicial capacity. However, under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the Lord Chancellor ceased to be the Speaker of the Lords, and was replaced by the Lord Speaker. In addition, the Lord Chief Justice is now head of the judiciary, and the Lord Chancellor may no longer sit as a judge.</dd>

One of the maces accompanies the Lord Speaker into the Chamber and is placed on the Woolsack whenever the House meets.

(1) Practice which is the general understanding established over the centuries and does not need to be formally written down. (2) The Standing Orders which are the rules under which Parliament conducts its business and regulates the way Members behave and debates are organised. (3) In the House of Commons Rulings from the Chair relate to decisions on procedure which have been referred to the Speaker for clarification. In the House of Lords, procedure is developed by the House itself through the Procedure Committee which considers any proposals for changes to Standing Orders. (4) Other proceedings are controlled by Acts of Parliament which cover such things as taking the Oath or presenting Bills to Parliament.</dd>

At this stage the SI is called a proposed negative statutory instrument. Each Committee will consider if the procedure is appropriate to the content of the instrument and make a recommendation in its weekly report. After committee consideration, the Government will either sign the SI into law (make it) and then lay it as a made negative SI, or lay it as a draft affirmative SI.</dd>

Members of the House of Lords may not take their seats until they have obtained their writ of summons. Writs of summons are issued by direction of the Lord Chancellor from the office of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. New writs are issued before the meeting of each Parliament to all Lords who have a right to seats in the House.</dd>

                        <dd>Writs are legal documents which authorise the holding of a general election or by-election. When Parliament is dissolved prior to a general election, writs are issued declaring that an election be held in each constituency. The Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 removed the power of the Monarch to issue these writs, making it instead a statutory responsibility of the Lord Chancellor and, for Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. For a by-election the writ is issued by the Speaker of the House of Commons.</dd>
